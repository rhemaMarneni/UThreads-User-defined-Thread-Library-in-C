# UThreads-User-defined-Thread-Library-in-C
Created a user-defined thread library to perform multi-threading operations - creating, yielding, joining, destroying, mutex-locking, and unlocking threads. Scheduled the threads using 3 scheduling policies: Round Robin, Pre-emptive SJF and Multilevel Feedback Queues.
